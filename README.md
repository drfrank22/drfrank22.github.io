This repo is the start of my portfolio and will continue to be worked on and adjusted over time.
As the project currently stands, it has 4 pages of content, with working links moving across all 4 pages.
The Home page has a simple about me and a couple of pictures.
The More About Me page has a couple of cards.
The Portfolio page is set up to have projects imported.
The Contact page has a form to submit your infomation as well as clickable social media links, email, and phone number.
This page has been constructed using Bootstrap and it responsive as you adjust the screen size.
One thing I am having an issue troubleshooting is once the screen shrinks and the navbar becomes the toggle, it is clickable, but nothing happens.
